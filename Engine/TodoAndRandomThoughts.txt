	Game loads StartupScene to initialize global resources. Specific ones will 
be loaded and unloaded for each scene (yaay!). The idea is to decouple 
everything from Game class, but the GraphicsDevice and SpriteBatch references 
which looks harder or even not doable.

	While resuming the work on TransformComponent, I noted that constructors can
be tricky. I want to limit the programmer - which, by now, is only me - to 
certain behaviors. If a >> Transform << component is needed, then sounds 
reasonable that a position is obligatory. But what if it is not? Maybe you just
want to use some rotations methods to create a directional light, which is 
fully independent of a position. Well, then use a Vector2.Zero and you're good 
to go :)
	Also, where the pivot variable should belong? We have to have a Vector2 
to know where's the center of our object. Then we can do this two things: to 
rotate a texture around there and to calculate distances using radius. For our 
first case, the variable belongs to SpriteComponent, but for the later one, to 
our TransformComponent. Looks like it's a transform thing, but then we have to 
return its value every time we call SpriteComponent.Draw(), which needs it to 
rotate the texture. Or maybe this is perfectly fine! I'm pretty sure I'm missing 
something here.
	And method "TranslateAbsolute" has a terrible name. Teleport is a better one,
but sounds... funny.
